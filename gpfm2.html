    <p class="w3-justify">  <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">For since by man</strong>     Adam   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">came death,</strong>     Because of his sin   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">by man</strong>      By Christ   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">came also the resurrection of the 
      dead.</strong>     So if he had not died, we could not be restored or come into immortality: if he had not been raised from the dead.  Let’s read that one again.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">For since by man 
      came death,</strong>      That’s how the curse came, because Adam sinned.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">by man</strong>     Christ   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">came also the resurrection of the dead.  For as in Adam all die, even so in 
      Christ shall all be made alive.</strong>        Now do not let that scare you, because there is a death that he speaks of that is not a physical death, but it is a laying down of every 
      desire of the flesh.  That he calls death also.  We have to recognize the two when we see it.  Do you know what I am saying about that?  There is a place where he says we have to put 
      down every desire of the flesh.  Now we cannot do it by ourselves.  It is as we come to the end of ourselves and the Lord helps us to overcome these things in our lives.  And by his 
      Spirit, he can remove them, the old root of sin that is in our heart.  He can take it out.  We cannot.  All we have to be is obedient to him, obedient to his Word, obedient to his Spirit 
      when he talks to us, and he does the taking out, Amen, because we do not know how, because we do not see the Spirit, but the Spirit does the work. We are really more spirit than flesh, 
      if we only knew it.  Once you become a new creation in Christ, once you have accepted Christ, he says you are a new creature, a new creation.  So we are Spirit and flesh, but the more 
      we walk with God, the more we obey the Word, the more Spirit we become and the less flesh.  Now we know that is true.  We do not act like we did when we first gave our hearts to 
      the Lord.  Our lives are changing all of the time.  That is true as you walk with the Lord.  Some turn back.  We know that.  A lot of times you will fall and get up and shake yourself 
      and you bump your head a few times and then you start on your walk again.  Amen.  But through all of that, we are still growing.  We are growing into that perfect picture that he has 
      for this end time. I have said many times if people would have believed the Word back there, like Elijah when he was taken up without dying, and Enoch was taken without death, because 
      they had faith to believe.  But there has not been a people like this people that is coming forth.  I do not know in what form they (Enoch and Elijah) will come back – if they will come 
      back as Sons or what; I don’t know.  It is none of my business.  He did not choose to tell it in the Word, and we cannot just think about what might happen.  But we know that these Sons 
      that he is raising up today, that we call Sons of God, are an entirely different breed.  They are going back right into the realm of God to where they are going to be lifted right out 
      into a many-membered body, Christ being the head of that body.  Amen.  </p>

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5"><span class="w3-animate-fading" style="opacity: 0.4"></span>  pp. 6</p>  
      
    <p class="w3-justify">  <strong class="w3-text-red">Philippians 2:5-9</strong>      <span></span>When he said   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Let this mind be in you,</strong>      He did not say do it, he said just let it be in you.  We do 
      not have to struggle for it.  Just let it.  Just walk in obedience.  Amen.  It is coming more and more and more that you do not know how you know things, but you just know things because 
      of the Spirit; we are becoming more Spirit.  The more we become Spirit beings, the more that we go back into that reverse action from Adam, the more we will have this mind of Christ.  
      He said,   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</strong>      Of equality, think of it, 
      with God.  To be equal.  He did not think there was anything wrong with that.  Do you know there is a people that is coming forth, whether you believe it or whether you do not?  I am 
      going to believe it because the Word says so: to where we will be equal.  Christ will be our head.  But all of the desires of the flesh man must go first.  I do not know when God is 
      going to do this, but I know it is not far off.  I have been assured of that.  Amen.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</strong>     You know, the more you 
      struggle with this, the less he will talk to you.  Don't you find that when you are just completely relaxed in the Lord and happy and not concerned about anything, he just talks and 
      talks and talks.   I get oh such a joy just letting him talk.  He gave me the most beautiful song this morning; I just sang it and sang it and put it down on paper.  I thought surely he'd 
      let me sing it today at the Bible Study.  So it's not quite the time yet.  The tune was gone. </p>  
       
     
    <p class="w3-justify">When I speak of the body, I am speaking of all, not just this little group, but the whole body of Christ.  Amen, for as many as are learning the Scriptures. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation,</strong>      Now isn't that a hard thing to never try to build a 
      reputation for yourself?  And when we can give that reputation over to the Lord and not care what others think, but to follow the Spirit, then you will really start to grow, to where 
      we just walk to please the Lord regardless of how it looks, no matter how we act, as long as we know that we are walking in the Spirit to please the Lord.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">But made himself of no 
      reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</strong>     That is humbling yourself.  Here we are trying to get out of this flesh realm, and he 
      willingly comes down, leaving all of his glory, and stepped right down to become a man and walk among us.  Amen.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And being found in fashion as a man,</strong>      There is no other 
      way that this could be done.  It had to be that he had to take on the very process of us in order to redeem us.  We know the blood of bulls and goats and so on and so forth could not do 
      it. He had to take on a flesh body himself and come in the likeness of man in order to be a sacrifice for man.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death 
      of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</strong>      </p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5"><span class="w3-animate-fading" style="opacity: 0.4"></span>  pp. 7</p>  

    <p class="w3-justify">  <strong class="w3-text-blue">John 5:18-27</strong>      <span></span>  <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that 
      God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</strong>     He has a plan.  God has a plan to bring man back on the same level as Christ because he is going to be the head, we the body.  
      That is what he said, this many-membered body.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Then answered Jesus and said unto them, <span class="w3-text-red">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, 
      but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</span> </strong>      Now this was before his death.  Do not get confused here.  This was 
      before he came back into the full authority that he had before he left and became a flesh man.  He was in the earth like we are today.  This was before his death.  Jesus was a flesh man 
      like us at this time and was an example for us to overcome death by the Spirit of life.  We do not have to die to come into this place – Jesus did – of full authority.  He only did it at 
      that time because he was a flesh man, although he was born of the Spirit.  His Spirit was of the Father.  And by the way, the blood comes from the Father and so his blood was pure.  This 
      is why he could be a pure sacrifice for sin because his Father was God.  So we are walking in flesh bodies with the Spirit of God in us.  If we have Christ, don’t we have the Spirit of 
      God and the Father in us?  You can’t separate the two.  Then we are in that same position.  It is about time that we woke up to that fact.  He said he could do nothing save that what he 
      would see the Father do. <span class="w3-text-red">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye 
      may marvel.</span> You see he did not know the end from the beginning here.  This is when he knew that he did just what the Father told him to do.  That was all. <span class="w3-text-red">
      For as the Father raiseth up the dead, </span> See, the Father did it. <span class="w3-text-red">and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. For the Father judgeth no 
      man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath 
      sent him. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life,</span> It is just as plain as can be. <span>and shall not come 
      into condemnation;</span> Do you know what condemnation is?  We always look at that as we have done something wrong.  The worst condemnation is death.  That is the worst condemnation 
      according to the scriptures.  And that is the last enemy to be overcome. <span class="w3-text-red">but is passed from death unto life.</span> This is all in that same package that he died 
      for.  And if you can’t receive it or can’t believe it, well, praise God anyhow.  I know what the Lord has spoken to me. <span class="w3-text-red">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour 
      is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</span> Now he said they are dead in trespasses and in sins, too, didn't he?  
      So there is that kind of a life when the Spirit quickens the understanding and they receive life. <span class="w3-text-red">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to 
      the Son to have life in himself;</span> Well, where is that life now, pray tell me?  It is in the Spirit, and we have the Spirit, don’t we?  Oh, I know that this is just hurting, just 
      hurting.  But you had better get a hold of it if you are coming into immortality, Amen. We have this life also in us if we are heirs and joint heirs with Christ.  </p> 

      <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5"><span class="w3-animate-fading" style="opacity: 0.4"></span>  pp. 8</p>  
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">The fullness of all things, he says, if we are joint heirs with him, over all of God's creation, not just over the earth here.  Now there is a people coming forth.  
      I do not know how many are going to receive this, but I cannot help it, but we know that the scripture says so. <span class="w3-text-red">And hath given him authority</span> Didn't he 
      say he is not ashamed to call us brethren?  We are brothers of Christ.  He says that we are heirs and joint heirs with him.  We are going to sit on thrones and rule and reign in the 
      earth with him. Well then, what are we saying?  What about the rest of it?  Just because it has never been taught.  We had better get a hold of it.  It is going to happen and we are 
      going to be sitting watching.  We're just going to be sitting. <span class="w3-text-red">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also,</span> Now then, he has received judgment 
      also, where he said God judges, back here. <span class="w3-text-red">because he is the Son of man.</span> He is a man, because he is the Son of man.  And they are the heirs. He was a man 
      just like Adam was a man.  Only his heart was pure like Adam's was before he sinned.  Only he was obedient in all things.  He did not sin.</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify">  <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">John 10:15-18</strong>        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"><span class="w3-text-red">As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep. And other 
      sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</span></strong>      There is a people that is 
      going to be one with Christ where he will be the head, and one with the Father.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"><span class="w3-text-red">Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might 
      take it again.</span></strong>      And this is exactly – he is asking no more of us, then that we lay down our life, whether we live or have to die, whichever, yet we completely give our 
      life.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"><span class="w3-text-red">No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.</span></strong>      Jesus said.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"><span class="w3-text-red">I have power to lay it down, 
      and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</span></strong>      Jesus is our example.  He had to lay his life down in death and overcome death that we 
      would not have to die, that we would not have to taste of death.  Well, if we will get a hold of it and receive it and start building on that, and as you read the scriptures, God will 
      reveal that to you.  These are truths that we have to get a hold of.</p>

      whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as 
      others. But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are 
      saved;)</strong>      He said he has put us together.  He has quickened us together with Christ.  I do not know where we get the notion he is way off somewhere and we cannot realize that he 
      is living within our hearts.  That is what the Bible says, that he does not dwell in temples made with hands, but he dwells in the heart of man.  That is his temple.  That is his 
      kingdom, Amen.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And hath raised us up together,</strong>      Christ and us together.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and made us sit together in heavenly places in  Christ Jesus:</strong>      Those heavenly 
      places are the glory and the place of authority, rulership, and all of that.  Christ has obtained all of this, and he wants to give it to us if we can receive it.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">That in the 
      ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.</strong>      Everything is in Christ.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">For by grace are ye saved through 
      faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath 
      before ordained that we should walk in them.</strong>     </p>
      
      
    <p class="w3-justify">  <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">John 6:27-29</strong>        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"><span class="w3-text-red">Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting 
      life,</span></strong>     Every time we see the words 'everlasting life', we have been so programmed in the churches that that means life after death.  And that is a lot of baloney.  That is 
      a lot of baloney.  I mean it.  Of course, that is reality too, that we do have life after death, but there is also a life that he has promised beyond, that we live without death.  
      If we cannot catch this – we know that we are living right in the very end time. </p>  

    
    <p class="w3-justify">We know that Christ could appear at any time.  And when he says 'the dead in Christ shall rise, and those that remain shall be caught up in the air to be with him', 
      he is talking about right out here, Amen.  They are going to rise up out of the grave, Amen.  And they are not going to be off somewhere a hundred miles from here because you cannot 
      breathe up there.  He says you are going to be here in the air, right here on the earth.  Amen.  Your kingdom is here.  You are never going anywhere but right here.  Did you know that 
      according to scripture?  This is where it is.  Right here.  This is where he came.  And the kingdom of God, the Bible says, is without observation.  You cannot see it, but it is in the 
      heart of man, Amen.  That is where his kingdom is.  Once you know what the city foursquare is, then you won't have any problem with this.  When you know what the city in Revelation is, 
      that came down from God.  It is the Bride, the Lamb's wife.  That is what the Bible says it is.</p> 
       
     
    <p class="w3-justify">That is what he said.  “Look at me.  I’m the kingdom of God.  It’s nigh at hand.”  That is what Jesus said. Amen.  It is the same Christ who was standing in Jerusalem 
      when he said those words, is the same Christ who lives in here.  It is nigh at hand.  It is here.  It has been here all of the time, since the beginning of time, since Adam was created 
      in the earth.  And it has always been in the earth, and it will always be in the earth because he made man to have dominion over the works of his hands.  And he still has not changed his 
      mind.  He is going to have a people that is going to have dominion over the works of his hands, and over all of his creation.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"><span class="w3-text-red">Labour not for the meat 
      which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</span></strong>      Then he just got 
      through saying that we were sealed and so is Christ sealed by the Father, Amen, into this, to bring this forth.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the 
      works of God?</strong>      Now they wanted some of this power that Jesus was showing forth.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Jesus answered and said unto them,</strong>        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"><span class="w3-text-red">This is the 
      work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</span></strong>      He has only told us to believe.  The works will follow the believer.  Isn't that what he said?  These works shall 
      follow them that believe.  We struggle so hard with trying to do the works and we are getting it all backwards all of the time.  He says if you just believe these works are going to 
      follow.  Amen.  Well, isn't that the truth? Eat what you can eat, and what you can’t, chew on it some more and it will be digested after a while. </p>

    <span class="w3-text-red">while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</span></strong> Then he says 'I go to my Father' and 
    'ye are the lights of the world'.  Amen.  Didn’t he say that?  Amen.  Now we are that Spirit.  If we continue in that Spirit of Christ and let him dominate, and believe the Word of God 
    like we are supposed to believe it, and know that we are the lights of the world like he said, "Now ye are the lights of the world."  We have a big responsibility.  You do not put a bushel 
    basket over a light.  You let it shine.  You can declare who you are.  You know who you are, not because I think so, but because the Word says so, and the Word is truth.</p>

      that is the truth, and it is the Word, then we have the Father in us also.  Don’t we?  Do we?   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"><span class="w3-text-red">Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father 
      in me?</span></strong>      That is what he said.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"><span class="w3-text-red">The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the 
      works.</span></strong>      Now I want to tell you something, but after Jesus' death, he talked differently.  We will get to that after a while.  He talked entirely different after that, 
      because he was given the full authority, while the Father rests, Amen.   <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"><span class="w3-text-red">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall 
      he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</span></strong>      Now we have tried to do these greater works in the condition that we are in – us 
      slopped up, sick, unbelieving Christians.  I mean it.  We are.  Because we have not received the Word and believed it, so we do not believe him for the works.  But there is coming a time 
      right soon when we are going to walk in a new life that we have not received yet.  And you talk about works.  Do you think you are going to have any time?</p>
      
    <p class="w3-justify">When we are in power or the fullness of Christ like he says that we are coming into; when he indwells all of this flesh; when he gets complete control of this flesh; 
      when he comes into these bodies with the fullness of himself which the Word of God says; when that happens, you see, Christ did not have any trouble getting a crowd.  He did not have any 
      trouble with getting people saved.  He just walked past Peter and said, "Follow me".  And Peter just chucked right along behind him and dropped his nets and everything else because of 
      all of the power of God that was in him.  That is because he was filled with the power and the glory of God.  And that is what he is going to bring forth in the earth, is a people filled 
      with that glory.  The Word is very plain on it.  And when he does, then that people is going to do the greater works than he did because he has gone to his Father.  Then are you going to 
      see the greater works come forth.  If we would receive that power now in our fleshly state without overcoming, we would blow ourselves all apart because we could not handle it.  We would 
      get pride. We would get everything else.  We would just disturb the kingdom of God.  That is what we would do</p>
