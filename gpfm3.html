    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> John 15:26-27</strong>  <strong><span class="w3-text-red">But when the Comforter is come,</span></strong> <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> </strong> Now the Spirit had not been given at this time, 
    remember, the Holy Ghost.  Christ in his Spirit had come into man but not in the proportion of the Holy Ghost. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> <span class="w3-text-red">But when the Comforter is come, whom 
    I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</span></strong> Now we have that Holy Ghost.  We have been baptized 
    in the Holy Ghost. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> <span class="w3-text-red">And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</span></strong>  Oh, you don’t mean it.  We have been 
    with him from the beginning?  He said we are predestinated to become Sons of God.  It was in God's plan.  Now he is telling you that you have been with him from the beginning.  He is no 
    respecter of persons.  We have been with him from the beginning too.  But we have not been aware of it.  Amen. You know what scripture I'm talking about, don't you?  When he said you're 
    predestined and you were with him from the foundation of the world?</p>


    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> Romans 13:11-14</strong>  <span></span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep:</strong>  And that is for sure, and 
    know who we are. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put 
    on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus 
    Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</strong>  I want to tell you.  You get enough life in the Spirit and you do not have to worry about the flesh.  
    The life of Christ kills the desires of the flesh and overcomes Satan in our lives.  So if you will just reverse it instead of trying to put the flesh down.  Seek after Christ.  Seek after 
    life.  Seek after the Spirit.  And when you start walking in the Spirit, you do not have to worry about the flesh.  It just naturally takes care of itself.  Amen.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> 1 Corinthians 15:23-26</strong>  <span></span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at 
    his coming.</strong>  Now, to clarify this for you: Christ was the first one to ever be resurrected from the dead.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> afterward they that are Christ's at his 
    coming.</strong>  And this same life, this Christ, is in us.  Remember that now, and he is in us also as we remain alive. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the 
    kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that 
    shall be destroyed is death.</strong> </p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> Galatians 2:16 </strong>  <span></span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have 
    believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</strong> </p>


    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> Galatians 3:2-3</strong>  <span></span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
    Are ye so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</strong>  And what they were doing, they were having ceremonies and rituals.  And we go through the same 
    kind of paraphernalia, in a measure, instead of just letting the Spirit do what he wants to do in our lives.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> Galatians 3:25-29</strong>  <span></span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.</strong>  Or under the law.  We try to stay 
        under that law yet, to the fact that we think that we have to do it. That is the law mixed with grace.  We do not have to do anything but believe the Word of God and let the Spirit do 
        the work in us that he has promised he would do and quit struggling with it.  Amen.  He will do it.  The Lord will do it by the Spirit.  He knows how to.  We only hinder God.  Although 
        if we are tempted with something, he told us to resist it and Satan will flee, and we are to overcome the desires of the flesh and let the Spirit do the work in us.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For 
        ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond 
        nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</strong>  Now if 
        you want to look up heirs sometime on the promises to Abraham, you will find out who you are too, because it tells it in there.  Remember that he said we are heirs of Abraham.  
        Everything that was promised to him, this great city, and all of this and so on and so forth, which is the city of the living God, which are the Sons of God.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> Galatians 4:1-7</strong>  <span></span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; 
        But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.</strong>  There is a time appointed of the Father when we will come into this fullness of God, when he says the 
        fullness of the Godhead dwelt in its fullness in Christ, and we are heirs and joint heirs with him, so we claim all of these things with this here. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Even so we, when we were 
        children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem them 
        that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts,</strong> That is Christ in 
        us. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.</strong>  So we are an heir of God through Christ.  
        An heir will rule and reign as kings and priests with the Lord.  That is what the Bible says. We have heard this negative preaching on these things for so long that it is hard for us 
        not to fall into that same pit.  To realize that if we knew what age we are living in, the fullness of time is upon us.  And all of these promises that he made to the ends of the earth 
        are upon us, for the Christian.  And he is getting ready to bring a people into the fullness to take over this world with Christ, Amen, and to rule and reign with him, like he said.</p>

        might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and 
        increasing in the knowledge of God;</strong> We have to just keep going.  We have to believe what we read.  We have to believe what we hear in the scriptures.  Ask God to reveal them by 
        his Spirit to you if you do not understand, to open your understanding. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power,</strong> Now look.  Strengthened with all

        thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</strong>  Or made us fit to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in 
        light.  And the light is the Spirit. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption 
        through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</strong>  Of every flesh man; he was the firstborn. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">  For

        struggling with it and trying to do what they are trying to do and cannot do it, then God is going to unleash his power in flesh vessels throughout the earth and they are going forth 
        as Christ in the earth, him being the head. </p>    
       
     
    <p class="w3-justify">If he could ever get a people, which he will.  He has promised that he would have a people who would come into complete obedience to him, absolute complete obedience 
        to him to where he can take those people, and they will be changed.  This corruptible will put on incorruptibility and then we will be changed, Amen, into that vessel. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he is 
        before all things, and by him all things consist.</strong>  Not just some things, all things consist by Christ. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the

        all things concerning the Church.  He doesn't have that now.  Once in a while, he gets to speak a word if the people will let him.  Most generally, it is flesh.  Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For it 
        pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;</strong>  Now if we are heirs and joint heirs; and the fullness dwells in him; and he is not ashamed to call us brethren; and he 
        is going to bring forth a people to rule and reign with him, which the Word says, then we also will be filled with all that fullness of God, because the fullness dwells in 
        Christ. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. 
        And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled: In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable

        reality to me.  The Lord has spoken to me personally concerning this, that I would not see death.  I know that I will live to see the end of all things.  How can I refuse that?  Then 
        when I hear a man on the 700 Club get up and say that he had died and the Lord sent him back, and he said. "You will never die again.  My coming is but a split second away in God's 
        timing.”  There are many, many, many that were sent back, that were raised from the dead.  And the Lord told all that he was going to do; how he was going to come to a people and how
