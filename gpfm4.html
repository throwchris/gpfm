    Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</strong> He did not say world did he?  He said 
    worlds. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Who being the brightness of his glory,</strong> Jesus being the brightness of God's glory. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> and the express image</strong> Of God <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> of his person, 
    and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; Being made so much better than the 
    angels, as he hath by inheritance</strong> And that is the way we are coming in, by inheritance, not by works, but because Christ is in us.  We will inherit. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Being made so much 
    better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten 
    thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship 
    him. And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of 
    righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</strong>Now he is speaking about the earth kingdom that is coming here.  And this is proclaimed by him and it will be forever and ever. </p>

    didst set him over the works of thy hands: </strong>Well, didn't he do that with Adam?  Didn't he set him over the works of his hands?  And now he is getting ready to set us over the works 
    of his hands.  Amen.  And I have news for you; we could do a lot more than we do, if we would just reach out and do it, and by faith know who we are. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Thou hast put all things in 
    subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him.</strong> Now any of your problems, sorrows, your temptations and all, 
    are under the feet of Jesus.  He overcame every bit of that for you.  He was tempted that we could overcome temptation. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But now we see not yet all things put under him.</strong> If 
    you look you cannot see everything, but by faith. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels</strong>He was made a little lower than the angels like us, then 
    wasn’t he? <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man. For it became him, for whom are all things, and 
    by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory,</strong>Does that blow your mind?  He is bringing many sons into glory just like Jesus. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> to make the captain of their 
    salvation perfect through sufferings.</strong>Jesus and us.  It is going to cost you something.  It is going to cost you all of your self flesh desires.  And let the Lord lead your life.  
    Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one:</strong> We are sanctified.  The Bible says we are.  So we are all one. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> for which cause he is

    took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</strong>This is the Word.  If I was just doing a lot of talking on these 
    things, if the Word did not back it up, I would throw it out and burn it.  Amen, but we are reading what God says about this, not what I think or what somebody else thinks.  This is the 
    Word of God. </p>

<p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red"> Hebrews 4:3-11</strong> <span></span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my 
    rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</strong> God had this plan.  It was complete before the foundation of the world. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For he spake in a certain 
    place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</strong> Now we know that that is speaking of the thousand years, when it took him 6 days or 
    6000 years, and now he is getting ready to bring this whole thing – we are at the end of the 6000 years, just coming into the 7th day.  And we know that God rested after the 6 days 
    (Whatever length of period of time it was.) when he made the earth.  And he rested on the 7th day.  This is what he’s talking about.  Genesis 2:2, it says that, if you want to look it 
    up. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in 
    because of unbelief:</strong> Do you hear what he is saying?  He said some of them did not.  They could have entered in before. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter 
    therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief: Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day 
    if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</strong> Do you see what he is saying? <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> if
    Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</strong> Jesus paid the way for us, but we have not come into that yet – that time of perfect rest.  
    Do you think you are going to be worrying after you are filled with the glory of God, when you become just like God himself, practically, in Christ?  And all of the fullness of God is in 
    Christ, and he is going to dwell in his fullness in a people.  Do you think you are going to be worrying about things, be concerned and fretful?  No, because you will have creative power, 
    you will be everything.  This is scripture again; this is no false teaching, believe me.  Because I have a lot of friends throughout the United States that are teaching the same, that have 
    received these revelations from Christ. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> There remaineth therefore</strong>There still remaineth. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also 
    hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</strong> We have not ceased yet, so we have not entered yet.  We are still struggling, but we will know when that day comes. 
    Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</strong> After he warns us like this, how can we not believe?</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">Do you want to go back and serve the world: this putrid world, Amen, that we have all had a taste of?  Amen.  We have all been rotten and filthy. God has cleansed us 
        and shapened us up.  Praise God, for we do not want to lie anymore, we do not want to steal anymore, we do not want to go out and get drunk anymore, we do not want to do all of those 
        things anymore.  Praise God.  And only God can take those desires out of us.  He has brought us this far.  Amen.  He can bring us the rest of the way.  Now he is working on those little 
        things, like envy and strife and backbiting and whispering and all of those little things: speaking when we are not supposed to speak, and keeping our mouths shut when we are supposed 
        to speak.  When we should speak, we do not.  Amen.</p>

        please the world and serve Christ.  The first thing that they will say is, "You are crazy".  That is the starter.  Then they will say, "You are all mixed up and you are crazy".  But we 
        are not to care, since the Lord has given his life that we might come into this inheritance.  And there are only 144,000, do you realize, in the scriptures, of that firstfruits 
        company?  There will be many, many more come into it later according to the scriptures, but there are only 144,000 out of the whole world that is going into that firstfruits company at 
        the first outpouring of the Spirit.  And that is not very many, considering the whole world.  And then there will be many more that will come in through them, that will be purified and 
        cleansed, because then they will have power just like Christ had power, to help them to overcome.  And there will be many that will overcome in that day.</p>
